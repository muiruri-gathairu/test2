            <p> Earth went up to Mars. The old friends greeted each other heartily. Although, secretly, Mars was growing to dread the conversations with Earth more every year. The inhabitants of Earth were planning on moving to his planet in the future. Mars was an old and conservative planet and although he had been waiting for proper lifeforms to evolve on his planet, they simply had not succeeded to his liking. He had grown lonely, dusting himself off all year, until the Sunâ€™s party. However, he did not like the idea of the arrogant inhabitants of Earth roaming around his planet and changing his natural order, not to mention disturbing his peace of mind! </p>
